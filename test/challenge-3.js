/**
 * challenge 3.
 *
 * Suppose you have a task that computes a single value.  That value is obtained
 * by aggegating simple integers.  Suppose that it:
 * - gets the first value, using a function a()
 *     - the aggregate is updated via `aggregate = someFunction(a_result)`
 * - gets the second and third values, via b1() and b2(), in asyncronously in parallel
 *     - the aggregate value is updated by `aggregate += someFunction(a_result + b1_result)`
 *       and `aggregate += someFunction(a_result + b2_result)`
 * - gets final value from c(), and aggregates just as above
 *     - the aggregate value is updated by `aggregate += someFunction(a_result + b1_result + b2_result + c_result)`
 *
 * in other words, the value is obtained using the following control flow:
 *   a     // tier 1 get a, aggregate
 *  / \
 * b1 b2   // tier 2 get b1, b2, aggregate
 * \  /
 *  c      // tier 3 get c, aggregate
 *
 * Each of these functions, however, are asynchronus.  Modify the `controller`
 * code to honor the control flow described above and satisfy the test.
 * The `entry` function expresses the intent of what you need to do, as if all
 * of the code was written synchronously.  In the above hypothetical, we reference
 * `someFunction`, but in the actual code below, `getTierValue` plays this role.
 *
